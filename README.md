Tadukoo Plugin
==============

Tadukoo Plugin is a plugin currently in progress for Bukkit, it is being made
for Minecraft 1.6.1, and will include various commands, an economy, permissions,
and much more. Its purpose is as a plugin for [Tadukooverse] (http://tadukooverse.wikia.com).

Tadukoo Plugin is in very early stages of development, so there's not much in it yet, so there may be some

It may be changed in the future.
