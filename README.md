Tadukoo Plugin
==============

Tadukoo Plugin is a plugin currently in progress for Bukkit, it is being made
for Minecraft 1.6.2, and will include various commands, an economy, permissions,
and much more. Its purpose is as a plugin for [Tadukooverse] (http://tadukooverse.wikia.com).

Tadukoo Plugin is in very early stages of development, so there's not much in it yet, so there may be some 
features or commands that are just for testing at the moment. Also, Tadukoo Plugin is the working name.
It may be changed in the future.
